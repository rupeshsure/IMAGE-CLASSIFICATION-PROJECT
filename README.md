# ABSTARCT
Basically this project deals with image classification which was carried out with the help of machine learning instead of deep learning techniques. This project is completely based on facial recognization using machine learning classifiers. The facial patterns were been detected wuth the help of haar cascade files. The files help in seeing the eyes and face of a human. The logistic regression provided the best results in achieving an accuracy of 88%. This project completely deals with facial recognition based on face patterns with the help of haar cascade files, not with the help of local binary patterns.
# METHODOLOGY
The normal image is converted into a grey scale image it's done because ML models can only recognize greyscale images.

# This is original image as RGB pattern

# This image is a greyscale image that was converted from a normal image.
